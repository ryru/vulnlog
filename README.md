Vulnlog is a YAML format and a CLI for recording how vulnerabilities affect your software, and for generating
suppression files, reports, and OpenVEX documents.

You record your analysis once, in a Vulnlog file in your Git repository. Vulnlog generates what your scanners, your
team, and your customers need from it. Vulnlog doesn't scan your software. It works alongside your scanners.

> [!NOTE]
> Vulnlog is in active development. The YAML format, the CLI commands, and the Gradle plugin may still change.

## Get started

Install the CLI:

```sh
curl -fsSL vulnlog.dev/install | sh
```

For every other installation method and a first tutorial, see the [documentation](https://vulnlog.dev/docs/).
